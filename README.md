This is a design project completed as part of my junior year coursework for the NE3206 course. A miniature prototype fuel handling machine seemed something doable back then.
An arduino based microcontroller was used to automate the machine. All the parts were assebled by hand in the mechanical workshop of the University of Dhaka.

Here is a video of this working before the final showcasing.
